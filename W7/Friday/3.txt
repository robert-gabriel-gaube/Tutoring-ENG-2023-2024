2 a) MS k B <-> LS k B

Solve plan 
	
	1. Extract most significant k bits (Based on: n >> k & 1)
	2. Extract least significant k bits (Based on: n >> k & 1)
	3. Reset most significant k bits (Based on: n & ~(1 << k))
	4. Reset least significant k bits (Based on: n & ~(1 << k))
	5. Set most significant k bits as least significant k bits
		(Based on (n | (1 << k))
	6. Set least significant k bits as most significant k bits
		(Based on (n | (1 << k))
