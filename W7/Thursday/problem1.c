/*
    Rotate the nibbles of a given unsigned number by moving the middle two hex symbols to the edges. 
    For example,
        0x12344321 becomes 0x41233214 after rotation
        0x12345678 becomes 0x41236785. 
        
        The unsigned number is represented in 8 hex symbols, and each nibble is 1 hex symbol.
