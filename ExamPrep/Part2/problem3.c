/*
    You are given a file containing lines, each representing a point in the XY plane. 
    Each line consists of two floating-point numbers separated by a space, 
    representing the coordinates {x, y} of a point. 
    
    Write a C function that takes the input file as a parameter, processes each line, 
    and prints out the points in order based on their distance from the point {0, 0}. 

    Where distance from {x1, y1} to {x2, y2} is sqrt(pow(abs(x2 - x1), 2) + pow(abs(y2 - y1), 2))
