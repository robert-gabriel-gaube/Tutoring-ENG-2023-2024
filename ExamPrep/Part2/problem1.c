/*
    Run-Length Encoding (RLE) is a simple form of data compression where consecutive elements of 
    the data that are the same are replaced with a single value and the count of occurrences. 
    
    In this problem, you are required to implement a C function that encodes a C-style string 
    given as a parameter into its RLE form.
