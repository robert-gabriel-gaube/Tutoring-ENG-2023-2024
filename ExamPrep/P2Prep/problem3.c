/*
    Implement a C function that will find, search and replace text strings. 
    Receives three strings (s1, s2 and s3) and replaces all the occurrences 
    of string s2 into the first string (s1), with the third string (s3),
    returning the new string. The replacement phrase can be shorter or longer
    than the searched for phrase. Show the updated initial line of text on the display.
